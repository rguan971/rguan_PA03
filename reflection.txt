1. Joshua Alvarado’s feedback: Great usage of bootstrap features and forms! I like the idea, but I definitely believe that you should add more functionality to the "Goal" page. You are trying to get a lot of data from the user, and it would be impressive if you were able to successfully store it and relay it back to the user.

2. Nina Xu’s feedback: First, I don’t know what purpose the website build for. Maybe the “userChoose” page should be moved to the home page so that users will be easier to catch it. Second, the bootcamp design is ugly. I recommend to use completely CSS.


*********

1) remove the insecure package and use Meteor methods for all of your database operations
Done!

2) run a user test on your app with two people in class and get their feedback on your app
Please see the above.

3) using CSS on at least one page (in addition to any Bootstrap) and use flexboxes 
There is a about.css contain flexboxes to format the pictures in "Our goal" page.
There is a home.css file in ./pages/home/client folder. It works for all pages.


4) make it more useable
Keep improving.
